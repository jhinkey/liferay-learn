# Configuring Templates

Once you've configured a widget, *Configuration Templates* can save those
settings in a reusable template. If someone goes in and changes the settings of
a particular widget, it then becomes easy to revert those changes back to the
original configuration template. 

```{note}
Configuration templates are only available for widgets placed on a page. Applications available from the Product Menu do not provide configuration templates.
```

To create a configuration template, do as follows:  

1. Click on *Options* (![Options](../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) from the menu in the widget's title bar &rarr; select *Configuration Templates*. 

If widget's current settings are the ones you want to save, click the *Save Current Configuration as Template* button. If not, change the settings until it's configured the way you want it, and then click the button.

1. There is only one field to fill out. Enter a name for your template and click
*Save*. You should now see your configuration in the list. If you ever need to
revert the app to these archived settings, you can click *Actions* (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) &rarr; *Apply* next to the configuration template you want to apply.

Unless otherwise noted, all widgets in @product@ support this feature. This is
particularly useful for widgets that have a lot of configuration options, such
as the Message Boards application.
