You have access to a powerful set of taglibs for creating commonly used UI components in your apps, themes, and web content. The following taglibs are covered in this section:

* AUI: create common UI components such as forms, buttons, and more.

* Chart: visualize data. Create bar charts, line charts, scatter charts, spline charts, and much more. 

* Clay: create [Clay components](https://clayui.com/docs/components/alerts.html), such as alerts, buttons, drop-down menus, form elements, and more for your apps. 

* Frontend: create UI components commonly used throughout Portal's apps, such as add menus, cards, management bars, and more.

* Liferay UI: create common UI components such as icons, tabs, and more.
  
* Liferay Util: load additional resources, define parameters, buffer content, and more.

```{note} 
Each taglib is available as a FreeMarker macro, except for the Chart taglib. The Chart taglib is **not** available as a FreeMarker macro. The articles in this section provide the proper syntax to use for each macro. See the [FreeMarker Taglib Mappings reference](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029145851-FreeMarker-Taglib-Macros) for a complete list of the available FreeMarker taglib macros.

In this section, you'll learn how to use taglibs to build awesome user interfaces for your apps!
