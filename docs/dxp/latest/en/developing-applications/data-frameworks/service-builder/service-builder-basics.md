A great way to start learning Service Builder is to use it. Here are the basics:

1. [Generating Model, Persistence, and Service Code](./service-builder-basics/generating-model-persistence-and-service-code.md) - You'll define a basic model, generate code from it, and deploy the code to DXP. You'll verify the generated database tables and test the generated service.

1. [Understanding and Extending Generated Classes](./service-builder-basics/understanding-service-builder-generated-classes.md) - Describes the generated classes and extension points. You'll add a service operation by extending a service and publishing it to the API via Service Builder.

1. [Invoking a Service Locally](./service-builder-basics/invoking-a-service-locally.md) - Demonstrates using the service in a portlet application.
