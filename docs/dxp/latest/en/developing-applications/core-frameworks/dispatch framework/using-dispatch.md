# Using Dispatch

[Dispatch](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/master/modules/apps/dispatch) is a dynamic/versatile<!--w/c--> framework built on top of Liferay's scheduler engine that you can use to run and schedule any type of logic. This framework uses the `DispatchTaskExecutor` interface to define templates with custom logic that you can use to [create tasks](#adding-a-new-dispatch-task) via the Control Panel. Once a Dispatch Task is created, you can configure its behavior and [schedule](#scheduling-the-dispatch-task) when it executes. <!--Examples of Dispatch Tasks include custom Talend data integration jobs, __, and __.-->

Dispatch also provides a convenient UI for viewing and managing all [scheduled jobs](#viewing-and-managing-scheduled-jobs) across a Liferay instance.

## Adding a New Dispatch Task

Follow these steps to add a new Dispatch Task to a Liferay instance:

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), click on the *Control Panel* tab, and go to *Configuration* &rarr; *Dispatch*.

1. Click the *Add* button (![Add Button](../../images/icon-add.png)), and select the desired template for your Dispatch Task. The selected template defines the Task's essential logic.

   Each template is an implementation of the `DispatchTaskExecutor` interface, and each Dispatch Task is an instance of the selected template. See [Understanding the Dispatch Framework](./understanding-the-dispatch-framework.md) for more information about how it works.

   ```note::
      Liferay DXP provides a variety of Dispatch Task templates to choose from, while Liferay Portal CE only includes the Talend Dispatch Task Executor.
      
      You can also create your own templates. See `Creating a New Dispatch Task Executor <./creating-a-new-dispatch-task-executor.md>`_ to learn how.
   ```

   ![Click the Add button, and select a Dispatch Task Executor template for your Dispatch Task.](./using-dispatch/images/02.png)

1. Enter a *name* for the Dispatch Task.

1. (Optional) Use the settings editor to define properties for the Dispatch Task that are injected into it at runtime.

   These settings can be used to fine tune execution flow or even pass further to underlying job.<!--Could you clarify what you mean by "pass further to underlying job"?-->

   All settings added in this way are soft-coded, so you can configure your Dispatch Tasks in runtime without having to edit and redeploy the Executor's code.

   ```tip::
      You can create multiple instances of the same Dispatch Task Executor and modify their properties and behavior using the settings editor.
   ```

1. Click on *Save* to create a new Dispatch Task for the selected template.

   ![Enter a name, and optionally use the settings editor to define properties for the Dispatch Task.](./using-dispatch/images/03.png)

All Dispatch Tasks added to an instance are listed in the Dispatch page. From here, you can click on the task to edit its settings, or configure its Dispatch Trigger to schedule when it runs. You can also click *Run Now* to manually execute the task. The *Logs* tab lists a record of all executions for the selected Dispatch Task.

## Scheduling the Dispatch Task

By default, all Dispatch Task Triggers are deactivated at creation. Follow these steps to activate a Task's Dispatch Trigger and schedule when it runs:

1. Go to the *Dispatch Triggers* tab in the Dispatch page, and click on the desired Dispatch Task.

1. Click on the *Dispatch Trigger* tab, and configure the following fields.

   ![Schedule when the Dispatch Task runs.](./using-dispatch/images/05.png)

   * **Active**: Activate or deactivate the Dispatch Trigger. To activate the Trigger, you must enter a valid cron expression. When active, the Dispatch task is executed according to the set schedule. Deactivating it prevents the Trigger from running.
   * **Task Execution ClusterMode**: Determine whether the Dispatch Task is run on one or all nodes in a clustered environment.
   * **Overlap Allowed**: Enable or disable  concurrent execution for the Dispatch Task. When enabled, new task executions are initiated according to the set schedule, regardless of whether a previous execution is still running.
   * **Cron Expression**: Enter a valid Cron expression to determine when the Dispatch Task is executed.
   * **Start Date**: Determine the Dispatch Task's start date.
   * **End Date**: Use the checkbox to determine when the Dispatch Task is no longer executed by the cron schedule. It is set to the current date and time by default.

1. Click on *Save*.

The Dispatch Task will now automatically start and stop at your specified date/time and according to the cron intervals.

## Setting Up a Talend Dispatch Task

Talend is open source data integration software that you can use to define custom data integration jobs. These jobs can then be exported as a `.zip` archive and uploaded to any Dispatch Task that uses the Talend executor template. Once uploaded, the Talend data integration job is executed whenever the Dispatch Task is run.

Follow these steps to upload a Talend *Job Archive* to a Dispatch Task:

1. Add a new Dispatch Task to your instance using the Talend executor template. See [Adding a New Dispatch Task](#adding-a-new-dispatch-task) for detailed instructions.

1. Go to the *Dispatch Triggers* tab in the Dispatch page, and click on the desired Dispatch Task.

1. Click on the *Talend* tab.

   ![Click on the Talend tab, and upload your Talend Job Archive](./using-dispatch/images/06.png)

1. Upload the ZIP file for your Talend *Job Archive*.

1. Click on *Save*.

## Viewing and Managing Scheduled Jobs

The *Scheduled Jobs* tab of the Dispatch Page also lists all jobs scheduled on the Liferay instance using the `MessageListener` interface. Here you can view general details for each job (e.g., name, status), as well as manually initiate runs or pause/resume jobs individually.
