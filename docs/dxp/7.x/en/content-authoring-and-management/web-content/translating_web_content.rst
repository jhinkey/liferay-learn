Liferay includes two methods for providing translations of web content:

- `Manual translation of web content through the UI <./translating-web-content/manually-translating-web-content.md>`_
- `Exporting web content in XLIFF format and importing translations <translating-web-content/exporting-and-importing-translations.md>`_

.. note::
   Users who are just starting out with localizing their installation of Liferay can learn more by reviewing `Initial Instance Localization <../../installation-and-upgrades/setting-up-liferay/initial-instance-localization.md>`_
