# High Security Database User Practices

> **Note:** The simplest, easiest way to maintain a Liferay DXP database is through a database user that has full database permissions up to and including permissions to Create and Drop tables. Such a user enables Liferay DXP to maintain its database automatically during upgrades and enables seamless functionality of Liferay DXP plugins that interact with the database. See [Configuring a Database](./configuring-a-database.md) for more information.

Your organization may have more stringent security policies that require limiting database Liferay DXP database user permissions once the database is initialized. If permissions for Select, Insert, Update and Delete operations are the only ones allowed for the user, you must initialize and maintain the database manually. Here's what's recommended to accomplish this:

1. Grant full rights for the Liferay DXP database user to do anything to the database.
1. Install Liferay DXP and start it so that it automatically populates the database.
1. Once the database has been populated with the Liferay DXP tables, remove all permissions from the Liferay DXP database user except permissions to perform Select, Insert, Update and Delete operations.

> **Warning:** There are some caveats to running Liferay DXP with these constraints. Many plugins create new tables when theyâ€™re deployed. Additionally, you must manually run the database upgrade function to upgrade Liferay DXP. If the Liferay DXP database user does not have adequate rights to create/modify/drop tables in the database, you must grant those rights to that user before deploying one of these plugins or starting the Liferay DXP upgrade. Once the tables are created or the upgrade completes, you can remove those rights until the next deploy or upgrade. If your team creates plugins that create their own tables, you must similarly grant temporary rights to the Liferay DXP database user before deploying the plugin.
